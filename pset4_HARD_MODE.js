/*
    In this PSET, we will attempt to recreate select Array methods
    The first few will be simpler, the last few will not
    
    Each problem will point back to the MDN documentation associated
    with the method. Consult the docs for information on how to
    implement (mainly a time saving measure, writing jsdocs is time
    consuming)
    
    Some problems may have additional challenges to consider.
